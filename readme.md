*   **LocalStorage Only:** Your inputs are saved in your browser's local storage for convenience, not on a server.
*   **MIT Licensed & Open-Source:** The code is completely transparent for review.
*   **Secure Coding Standards:** No unsafe `eval()`, strict scoping, and sanitized inputs.
*   **Repo Security:**
    *   `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting guidelines.
    *   GitHub Actions for CI/CD and linting.
    *   Automation: Dependabot + CodeQL scanning.
