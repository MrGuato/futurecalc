### üåê Why I Built My Own
I use a lot of online calculators for wealth projections and ideas, but most of them:  
- Track your data or send it to external servers  
- Are closed-source ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù with unknown assumptions  
- Don‚Äôt consider security, transparency, or DevOps best practices  

FutureCalc is my response:  
- **No tracking, no data collection** ‚Üí everything runs 100% in your browser  
- **Open-source & auditable** ‚Üí anyone can review how calculations work  
- **Security-first build** ‚Üí structured as a DevOps/Security Engineer project  
  - Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions  
  - Linting, CodeQL, and Dependabot for code quality & vulnerability scanning  
  - Clear `SECURITY.md` and MIT license for professional repo hygiene  

This project bridges **personal finance literacy** with **secure engineering practices**:  
helping people understand money safely, while showing how modern DevSecOps methods can be applied even to something as simple as a calculator.  

> *Educational tool only ‚Äî not financial advice. Returns shown are hypothetical.*

## üõ°Ô∏è Cyber / Security Engineering Focus
FutureCalc is also built as a **showcase of secure engineering practices**:

- **No Backend / No Data Collected** ‚Üí runs 100% in your browser  
- **LocalStorage Only** ‚Üí inputs saved in your browser for convenience, never sent to a server  
- **MIT Licensed & Open-Source** ‚Üí transparent and auditable code  
- **Secure Coding Standards** ‚Üí no unsafe `eval()`, strict scoping, sanitized inputs  
- **Repo Security**:  
  - `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting  
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD and linting  
  - Automation: Dependabot + CodeQL scanning  

*This demonstrates a **DevSecOps mindset**: security and hygiene are important, even for a simple educational tool.*
